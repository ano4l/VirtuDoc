# VirtuDoc deployment stack

This app is a Node/Express document workspace with a local SQLite store by default. The repository is configured for Vercel previews, Supabase as the hosted Postgres target, Resend transactional email, and a later Railway cutover for a persistent Node runtime.

## Vercel

Vercel uses `api/index.js` as the Node 22 serverless entrypoint and rewrites all routes to the Express app.

Required project settings:

- Build command: `npm run build`
- Install command: `npm ci`
- Output directory: leave empty
- Node runtime: `22.x`

Environment variables:

```text
NODE_ENV=production
MONEYFY_DB=/tmp/virtudoc.sqlite
MONEYFY_UPLOAD_DIR=/tmp/virtudoc-uploads
MONEYFY_EMAIL_PROVIDER=resend
MONEYFY_RESEND_API_KEY=...
MONEYFY_EMAIL_FROM="VirtuDoc <billing@yourdomain.com>"
SUPABASE_URL=...
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=...
SUPABASE_DB_URL=...
```

Important: Vercel function storage is ephemeral. Use this Vercel target for preview/demo deployments until the SQLite store is replaced by the Supabase/Postgres adapter, or deploy production on Railway with a persistent volume/database.

## Supabase

The target schema lives in:

```text
supabase/migrations/20260712000000_init_virtudoc.sql
```

Recommended setup:

```powershell
supabase link --project-ref <project-ref>
supabase db push
```

The schema mirrors the current document ledger: customers, products, documents, payments, templates, delivery attempts, reminder policies, recurring invoices, media metadata, settings, and audit history.

Security note: RLS/auth policies are intentionally not enabled yet because the current app is still local/no-auth. Before public multi-tenant production, add Supabase Auth, workspace ownership columns, RLS policies, and server-side authorization checks.

## Resend

The app already uses a provider abstraction in `email-provider.js`.

To enable Resend:

```text
MONEYFY_EMAIL_PROVIDER=resend
MONEYFY_RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxx
MONEYFY_EMAIL_FROM="VirtuDoc <billing@yourdomain.com>"
```

Every document send includes a generated PDF attachment and an `Idempotency-Key`. Provider acceptance is recorded before drafts become sent; provider failures are stored without finalizing the draft.

## Railway handoff

Railway config is provided in `railway.json`. When moving from Vercel preview to a persistent production runtime:

1. Provision Railway Postgres or connect Supabase Postgres.
2. Set `DATABASE_URL` and the same Resend variables.
3. Keep `npm start` as the start command.
4. Point health checks at `/api/health`.
5. Replace the SQLite store with the Postgres adapter before relying on production data durability.
